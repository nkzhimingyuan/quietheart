This example shows the simple use of Mmap shared memory.

Usage
*shared memory between parent&chile relationship process:start server and client as child with /dev/zero mmaped.
$mmap1
Then server wait , client send and exit, server received and print then exit.


*shared memory between parent&chile relationship process:start server and client as child with anonymous mmap:
$mmap2
Then server wait , client send and exit, server received and print then exit.

*shared memory between two processes:start server and client with a normal file:./mmap_shared mmap:
$mmap3_serv
$mmap3_client

Note
For two process have relationship, such as parent and child, We can only use mmap specific device file or anonymous mmap for  shared memory.
We can use /dev/zero for mmap, or MAP_ANONYMOUS flag for mmap without file.
For two any processes, we can use mmap shared memory only by mmap a normal file and we should ensure that the file size not small than the mmap size.
